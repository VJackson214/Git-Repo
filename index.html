    <h2 id="about-victor">Victor Jackson</h2>
    <p>My name is Victor Jackson and I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. I enjoy spending time with my kids (I have 3),
        reading, and watching TV. I have won awards back in high school, but outside of being a father, I believe that
        my decision to go back to school to finish is my biggest accomplishment.</p>

    <p>I want to be able to provide a better life for my kids as well as myself, and I think this is the best way to do
        that and also show them that there is nothing wrong with working hard for what you want in life.</p>

    <h2 id="why-don-cheadle">Why I Selected Don Cheadle</h2>
    <p>I selected Don Cheadle because he has had a long career and is one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, but
        not necessarily one of the most celebrated. I admire his work as well as how he has avoided a lot of negative
        press and attention. One of my favorite Don Cheadle roles is Basher in the Ocean's Eleven franchise.</p>

    <h2 id="don-cheadle">Don Cheadle</h2>
    <p>Don Cheadle is an acclaimed American actor, producer, and director, celebrated for his versatility and impactful
        performances...</p>

<h2 id="web-design">Web Design Course</h2>
<p>I am taking this Web Design course to learn how to code because I see that it will be a necessary skill not just
    in my degree plan but also in the workforce going forward. Web design and coding will be two useful skills to
    add to my toolbox.</p>

<p>Going back to the MySpace days (showing my age lol), I know a little about coding, but things have definitely
    advanced since then. I'm really looking forward to what the final product will look like as well as what I will
    learn along the way.</p>
