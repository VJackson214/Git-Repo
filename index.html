    <h1>Back Like I Never Left</h1>
    <h1>Victor Jackson</h1>
    <p>My name is Victor Jackson and I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. I enjoy spending time with my kids (I have 3),
        reading, and watching TV. I have won awards back in high school, but outside of being a father, I believe that
        my decision to go back to school to finish is my biggest accomplishment.</p>

    <p>I want to be able to provide a better life for my kids as well as myself, and I think this is the best way to do
        that and also show them that there is nothing wrong with working hard for what you want in life.</p>

    <p>I selected Don Cheadle because he has had a long career and is one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, but
        not necessarily one of the most celebrated.</p>

        developed his passion for acting.</p>

    <p>Cheadle’s career took off in the 1990s with notable roles in films like “Devil in a Blue Dress” (1995), but
        he
        gained widespread recognition for his performance in “Hotel Rwanda” (2004), where he portrayed Paul
        Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who sheltered refugees during the Rwandan genocide. This role earned him an
        Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, showcasing his ability to tackle socially relevant themes.</p>

    <p>In addition to his film work, Cheadle is known for his role as James "Rhodey" Rhodes in the Marvel Cinematic
        Universe, appearing in films like “Iron Man” and “Avengers.” His contributions extend beyond acting; he made

        in.

        issues like genocide and human rights abuses. With numerous awards to his name, including Golden Globes and

    <title>Web Design Course</title>

    <h1>Web Design Course</h1>
    <p>I am taking this Web Design course to learn how to code because I see that it will be a necessary skill not just
        in my degree plan but also in the workforce going forward. Web design and coding will be two useful skills to
        add to my toolbox.</p>

    <p>Going back to the MySpace days (showing my age lol), I know a little about coding, but things have definitely
        advanced since then. I'm really looking forward to what the final product will look like as well as what I will
        learn along the way.</p>
